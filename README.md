# Pokemon-Battle-Sim-v3
Third version of my Pokemon Battle Sim, with SFML library implemented.

This is the third version of my project. After this, I'll be working on making the code more efficient, and eventually making everything work in the SFML window.

This time, I added all of the project files, so for anyone that wants to test this, this was made in Codeblocks, so make sure that you have SFML properly 
installed on your computer along with Codeblocks so it can work.

For anyone that doesn't have SMFL setup, the guide I used to install SFML on my computer is this: https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-cb.php

Disclaimer: 

I DO NOT own Pokemon or anything related to Nintendo or Gamefreak. I am NOT making money on this, or selling anything related to Pokemon. I am simply using 
a franchise I like as a tool to help me relate to and learn how to code better.
